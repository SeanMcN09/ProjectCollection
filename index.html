            <p>
            My name is Sean, and I’m a web designer and developer focused on crafting professional, modern websites for individuals and small businesses.
            </p>
            <p>
            I started building websites as a creative outlet and quickly found a passion for designing pages that are not just visually appealing but also intuitive and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
            My goal is to make the process simple and stress-free for clients — from the first idea to the final launch. I value clean design, fast performance, and clear communication every step of the way.
            </p>
            <p>
            When I’m not coding, I’m usually experimenting with new layouts, improving my CSS animations, or learning better ways to make websites stand out.

                Build & Launch
                <p>I turn your design into a fully responsive, functional website — and help with setup if needed.</p>
